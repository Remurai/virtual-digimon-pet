This is a virtual Digimon pet (which can be known as Agumon) using Processing 3.
<br><br>
<li>The pet is able to elicit interactions and not simply respond to the user
<br>
<strong>(e.g. it can able to demonstrate that it is hungry or bored and ask to be fed or played with). </strong></li>
<br>
<li>In fact, the pet could have considerable autonomy to act while the user is
otherwise engaged on another desktop window, rather than just sitting
waiting.</li>
<br>
<li>It can be interacted with in ways which are intuitive and
â€œnatural". This application involves the pet interacting with on-screen objects
manipulated by the user.</li>
<br>
<li>It will change its behaviour over time by learning and remembering, by
adapting to the user and his typical actions or via the use of
<strong>"Evolution"</strong> which evolve into Greymon.</li>
